**Event App**

Event App is a simple web application that enables users to reserve a place for an event and event planners to create their event , choose the venue and add services. 
This application is developed using React.js, Flask and MySQL.
React.js is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces. Flask is a Python micro web application framework that provides libraries and tools to build RESTful APIs. MySQL is a database management system.
The purpose of this project is to showcase my ability to combine Frontend and Backend frameworks and libraries to create full stack applications.
